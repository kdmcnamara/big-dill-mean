    <h2 style="color: #000; font-family: Amatic SC; text-align: left">Big Dill and the Boys bring psychedelic rock tones to the modern jam scene. Formed in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 2015, the band has progressed over the years into a four piece powerhouse that blend a wide variety of musical influences and genres into an exciting experience, demonstrated best in their live performance. Its founding members include Will Hansen, Brendan Andrews, Kevin McNamara and Nick Spiroff.

With weekly shows throughout Wisconsin and occasional trips across the country to perform, Big Dill and the Boys are on a mission to provide rock and jam fans with a constant flow of music. The band has played in notable venues such as the Frequency, the High Noon Saloon, the Cactus Club, and other great Wisconsin venues. With plans in the near future to tour across the MidWest and other parts of the country, their roster of venues is only expanding.<br></br> <br></br>

 Big Dill and the Boys aim to improve their sound as they continue to make new music and improve upon their current material. Their sound expands upon music that came out of the 1960’s and 1970’s by an array of artists. The rhythmic and melodic interplay between the guitars, backed by a funky low end and punchy beats is what makes the sound unique. A live Big Dill and the Boys performance will take the audience on a journey that can only be felt at the show. Their studio work brings their songs into a different light that further exemplifies the band’s ability to create.<br></br> <br></br>

Big Dill and the Boys are releasing their first studio album titled “Dead on the Run” on August 17. With the release of their album, they are playing shows in Wisconsin, Iowa, Indiana, Colorado, among other states, in their Dead on the Run/ Smokin’ Beers 2018 summer tour.
